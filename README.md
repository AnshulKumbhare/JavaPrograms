Here, I would be adding up logics in a form of java code for solving various types of problems

Git commands:
1. git clone <repository_url>  --> To clone git repo/project to local machine'
2. git branch   --> to check total available branches
3. git branch <"Branch_Name">  --> To createa new branch with specified name from master/main branch
4. git checkout <"Branch_Name">  --> to checkout to spceified branch from current brenach / chnage current branch to specified branch
5. git status  --> to check what all are changes made in the branch
6. git add <file_name>  ---> to add file having changes to the local repo
    Ex: git add *.java
        git add *.txt
        git add ProgramFile/pattern.java
7. git commit -m "Write relavent message"  --> To commit changes to local branch
8. git push origin <"Branch_Name">   --> To push and made available local branch at the remote git repository
-------------------------------------------------------------------

9. git pull  --> if you are at main/master branch then use this command to pull whatever additional changes there at master/main
10. git pull origin <"Branch_Name">  --> if you want to pull from a feature branch
