Here, I would be adding up logics in a form of java code for solving various types of problems

Git commands:

git clone <repository_url> --> To clone git repo/project to local machine'
git branch --> to check total available branches
git branch <"Branch_Name"> --> To createa new branch with specified name from master/main branch
git checkout <"Branch_Name"> --> to checkout to spceified branch from current brenach / chnage current branch to specified branch
git status --> to check what all are changes made in the branch
git add <file_name> ---> to add file having changes to the local repo Ex: git add *.java git add *.txt git add ProgramFile/pattern.java
git commit -m "Write relavent message" --> To commit changes to local branch
git push origin <"Branch_Name"> --> To push and made available local branch at the remote git repository
git pull --> if you are at main/master branch then use this command to pull whatever additional changes there at master/main
git pull origin <"Branch_Name"> --> if you want to pull from a feature branch
